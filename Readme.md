# Description
This is a web application called Booking website. On this website, we have implemented features for the client to perform flight and hotel bookings. The goal is to create a website by following agile methodologies and collaborating in a team environment to distribute tasks and work with a specific chosen task. Here is the user walkthrough of the website

1. Registration/ Login – To book a flight/hotel, the user will have to first register in the system. Users can register using mobile number and email addresses.
2. NavBar: The navbar has the option to choose a flight or hotel for booking
3. Search: The search along with autocompleting feature allows the user to search flights/hotels for particular locations and dates Based on the search result the user will be shown a list of flights/hotels
4. Filter: This allows the user to filter the search results according to their requirements
5. Payment – Once the flight is confirmed or the hotel is booked, the user will be redirected to a payment gateway and on successful payment, the booking will be confirmed.
6. Current bookings/ history – logged-in user can see their current bookings and will have the choice to cancel bookings or reschedule until a certain date/time. Cancellation charges will be applied depending on when the user has made changes. Users can also view past bookings. This will only be available to the logged-in user.
