# Project Idea Goal
The goal is to create a website by following agile methodologies and collaborating in a team environment to distribute task and work with a specific chosen task. We will create a booking website for booking flights and hotels which will also include car rentals with the following features currently in mind
1. Registration/ Login – To book a flight/hotel/rental car, user will have to first register in the system. User can register using mobile no and email address.
2. Browse for flights, hotels, and rental cars- We will have listing pages for flights, hotels and rental cars where user can filter/sort depending on their choice or also can use their current location.
3. Payment – Once the flight is confirmed or hotel is booked, user will be redirected to a payment gateway and on successful payment the booking will be confirmed.
5. Current bookings/ history – logged in user can see their current bookings and will have choice to cancel bookings or reschedule until a certain date/time. Cancellation charges will be applied depending on when user has made changes. User can also view past bookings.
6. Reviews – User can rate their past hotels/flights/rental services on a scale of 5 and also leave a comment. Based on these ratings, we will sort based on ratings.
7. Dashboard – It will show popular flight destinations/ High rated hotels and discounts or any current deals.
8. Customer service
